CareConnect – Healthcare Support Web Prototype
CareConnect is a frontend-only healthcare support web application prototype designed to demonstrate responsive UI design, form handling, and a simulated conversational assistant for patient and volunteer support.
This project runs locally in the browser and requires no backend, server, or installation.
It is intended for learning, demonstration, and portfolio purposes, not production use.

🧠 Technical Details
This project intentionally avoids backend complexity and uses:
Tailwind CSS (CDN) – Utility-first styling for rapid UI development
Google Fonts – Outfit and Inter for clean, modern typography
Vanilla JavaScript – Simple, readable logic suitable for beginners
No frameworks. No APIs. No build tools.
⚠ Limitations
Be clear about this — hiding limitations is a rookie mistake.
No backend or database integration
Chatbot uses predefined responses (not real AI)
Form submissions are not stored or sent anywhere
No authentication or user accounts
🔮 Possible Future Improvements
Backend integration (Node.js / Firebase)
Real AI chatbot using an external API
Appointment booking system
Persistent form submissions
User authentication and dashboards
